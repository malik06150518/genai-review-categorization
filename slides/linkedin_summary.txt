LinkedIn Summary (short)

AI-enabled Product Feedback Analyst | QA-focused GenAI practitioner

I build practical, business-focused GenAI solutions that turn customer feedback into prioritized actions. 
I designed and delivered a GenAI Review Categorization system (MIT No-Code AI final project) that classifies sentiment, tags topics, prioritizes issues, and generates customer-first responses — all with reusable prompt engineering and lightweight deployment patterns. 
Seeking roles in AI Product, AI QA, or Feedback Intelligence where I can apply prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, and automation skills to deliver measurable outcomes.
